# Agent Skills

This project follows the [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io) spec.

## Directory Layout

Two directories serve different discovery systems:

| Directory | Discovery system | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| `skills/` | agentskills.io | Committed overrides + symlinks → `skills-vendor/` |
| `.claude/skills/` | Claude Code | Symlinks → `../../skills/<name>` |

Local overrides in `skills/` automatically shadow vendor skills in both systems. When adding a skill, always create both the `skills/<name>` entry and `.claude/skills/<name>` symlink.

## External Skill Repos (Git Submodules)

| Repo | Submodule path |
|---|---|
| [`gregoryfoster/skills`](https://github.com/gregoryfoster/skills) | `skills-vendor/gregoryfoster-skills/` |
| [`obra/superpowers`](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) | `skills-vendor/obra-superpowers/` |

Init after cloning: `git submodule update --init --recursive`

Submodule freshness auto-enforced by `UserPromptSubmit` hook in `.claude/settings.json`. Force-refresh: `git submodule update --remote --merge skills-vendor/gregoryfoster-skills skills-vendor/obra-superpowers`

To add a new external skill repo: follow the `managing-skills` skill.

## Skill Sources

For the trigger list of all available skills, see the **Agent Skills** table in `AGENTS.md`. Each project skill is sourced from one of:

| Source | Path | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Local override | `skills/<name>/` | Committed in this repo; supersedes any vendor copy of the same name |
| `gregoryfoster/skills` | `skills-vendor/gregoryfoster-skills/` | Cross-project skills authored for Cannabis Observer |
| `obra/superpowers` | `skills-vendor/obra-superpowers/` | Upstream community skills |

Description-driven skills (`systematic-debugging`, `verification-before-completion`, `test-driven-development`) activate from their description field rather than an explicit trigger phrase — they fire on any bug/test failure, before any completion claim, and before writing implementation code respectively.

## Local Overrides

A committed directory in `skills/` completely supersedes the vendor version (no inheritance). Must be fully self-contained.

| Skill | Override reason |
|---|---|
| `shipping-work-python-fastapi` | Thin override of upstream variant: sources `/etc/watcher/.env` + `$PROJECT_ROOT/.env` via `set -a; source; set +a` before delegating to upstream pre-ship; bracketed commit convention (`[type]` is literal) documented in Step 2 |
| `brainstorming` | Project conventions (docs/plans/ path, commit format); invokes using-git-worktrees after design approval; FastAPI stack context; proactive-suggestion mode |

## SocratiCode (Codebase Search)

This project is indexed with SocratiCode. Always use its MCP tools to explore the codebase before reading files directly.

**Core principle: search before reading.** The index gives you a map of the codebase in milliseconds; raw file reading is expensive and context-consuming.

### Workflow

1. **Start most explorations with `codebase_search`.** Hybrid semantic + keyword (vector + BM25, RRF-fused) in a single call. Broad queries for orientation ("how is auth handled"), precise queries for symbol lookup. **Use grep instead** when you already know the exact identifier, error string, or regex pattern.
2. **Follow the graph before following imports.** Use `codebase_graph_query` to see what a file imports and what depends on it before opening it. Check dependents before modifying or deleting.
3. **Use Impact Analysis BEFORE refactoring/renaming/deleting.** Symbol-level call graph (`codebase_impact`, `codebase_flow`, `codebase_symbol`, `codebase_symbols`) goes deeper than the file graph — it knows which functions call which.
4. **Read files only after narrowing via search.** Never read a file just to find out if it's relevant.
5. **Use `codebase_graph_circular`** when debugging unexpected behavior or import-related errors.
6. **Check `codebase_status`** if search returns no results — the project may not be indexed yet.
7. **Leverage context artifacts** for non-code knowledge (DB schemas, API specs, infra configs). Run `codebase_context` early; use `codebase_context_search` for specific schemas/endpoints.

### When to use each tool

| Goal | Tool |
|------|------|
| Understand what a codebase does / where a feature lives | `codebase_search` (broad query) |
| Find a specific function, constant, or type | `codebase_search` (exact name) or grep if you know the exact string |
| Find exact error messages, log strings, or regex patterns | grep / ripgrep |
| See what a file imports or what depends on it | `codebase_graph_query` |
| Check blast radius before modifying or deleting a file | `codebase_impact` (symbol-level) or `codebase_graph_query` (file-level) |
| What breaks if I change function X? | `codebase_impact target=X` |
| What does this entry point actually do? | `codebase_flow entrypoint=X` |
| List entry points in this codebase | `codebase_flow` (no args) |
| Who calls this function and what does it call? | `codebase_symbol name=X` |
| What functions/classes exist in this file? | `codebase_symbols file=path` |
| Search for symbols by name across the project | `codebase_symbols query=X` |
| Spot architectural problems | `codebase_graph_circular`, `codebase_graph_stats` |
| Visualise module structure | `codebase_graph_visualize` |
| Verify index is up to date | `codebase_status` |
| Discover what project knowledge (schemas, specs, configs) is available | `codebase_context` |
| Find database tables, API endpoints, infra configs | `codebase_context_search` |

> **Keep the connection alive during indexing.** Indexing runs in the background. Some MCP hosts disconnect idle connections. Call `codebase_status` roughly every 60 seconds after starting `codebase_index` until it completes.

### Linked Projects

Cross-project search to the sister `notifier` index is enabled via `SOCRATICODE_LINKED_PROJECTS=/home/exedev/notifier` in `.claude/settings.local.json` (gitignored — per-instance config, not a project commitment). The value may be relative (resolved from the project root) or absolute; absolute is recommended since the MCP server's CWD isn't guaranteed across hosts. Pass `includeLinked: true` on `codebase_search` to fan out across both indexes; results carry a `[watcher]` / `[notifier]` label.

## Authoring New Skills

Follow the `writing-skills` TDD cycle:
1. **RED** — run pressure scenarios without the skill; document where the agent fails
2. **GREEN** — write a minimal SKILL.md addressing those failures
3. **REFACTOR** — find new rationalizations, close loopholes, re-test

New project-specific skills go in `skills/<name>/` with a `.claude/skills/<name>` symlink to `../../skills/<name>`. Cross-project skills belong in `gregoryfoster/skills`.
