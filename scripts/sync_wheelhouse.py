"""Mirror the private cannobserv package index into the local wheelhouse.

Downloads every object under ``gs://co-gcs-pypi/wheels/`` into ``./.wheelhouse``
(repo root), skipping any file already present with a matching size. ``uv``
then resolves ``co-core`` / ``co-core-aio`` from that directory via the
``[tool.uv] find-links`` entry in ``pyproject.toml`` (#220).

Runs standalone, *before* ``uv sync`` — it must not import the project (whose
deps are what the wheelhouse provides), so invoke it in an isolated env:

    uv run --no-project --with 'google-cloud-storage>=2,<4' python scripts/sync_wheelhouse.py

Authentication is Application Default Credentials. On the VM/deploy that is the
service-account key at ``GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`` (set in
``/etc/watcher/.env``); in CI it is the ADC file written by
``google-github-actions/auth`` (keyless Workload Identity Federation). Either
way the identity needs only ``roles/storage.objectViewer`` on the bucket.

Exit codes: ``0`` success (including a no-op re-run) · ``1`` failure (auth,
network, or a missing bucket). The systemd unit runs this as a non-fatal
``ExecStartPre`` (``-`` prefix): a transient failure is surfaced to the journal,
and if the wheelhouse is already populated the service still starts — only a
genuinely missing wheel surfaces later as a hard ``uv`` resolution error.
