# Shipping Work — watcher

Finalizes work: lint, tests, clean commit, push, GitHub issue comments and closure.

## The Iron Law

```
NO PUSH WITHOUT PASSING TESTS — VERIFIED IN THIS SESSION
NO ISSUE CLOSURE WITHOUT FULL IMPLEMENTATION — VERIFIED AGAINST ORIGINAL REQUIREMENTS
```

## Rationalization prevention

| Thought | Reality |
|---|---|
| "Tests passed earlier in this session" | Run them again. State can change. Require fresh output. |
| "It's basically done, just needs minor cleanup" | Incomplete = not done. Finish or explicitly descope before closing. |
| "The issue will track follow-up work" | Only close if the core requirement is fully met. Open a new issue for follow-up. |
| "gh push is failing, I'll skip it" | Resolve the error. Do not mark as shipped without a successful push. |
| "User is in a hurry" | A bad ship is slower than a good one. Run the checklist. |

## Scope detection

Determine which GitHub issue(s) to close (priority order):
1. **Explicit scope** — user specifies issue number(s) (e.g., `wrap up #19 #20`)
2. **Conversation context** — issues referenced in recent commit messages or discussion
3. **Ask** — if ambiguous, confirm before closing anything

## Procedure

### Step 1 — Lint and test

```bash
bash skills/shipping-work-claude/scripts/pre-ship.sh
```

```
NO CONTINUATION IF TESTS FAIL
```

If tests fail: stop, report the failure, fix it before proceeding.

**Integration tests are always excluded** from `pre-ship.sh`. Run them explicitly with:
```bash
uv run pytest -m integration
```

### Step 2 — Ensure a clean working tree

```bash
bash skills/shipping-work-claude/scripts/check-status.sh
```

If uncommitted changes exist, commit them using this project's convention:
```
#<number> [type]: <description>       # with GH issue
[type]: <description>                 # without GH issue
```
Multiple issues: `#19, #20 [type]: <description>`
Types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `chore`

### Step 3 — Ensure on main

If on a feature branch, merge to `main` first. Then continue.

### Step 4 — Push

```bash
bash skills/shipping-work-claude/scripts/push.sh
```

### Step 5 — Comment on GitHub issues

For each issue in scope:

```bash
bash skills/shipping-work-claude/scripts/comment-issue.sh <number> "<summary>"
```

Comment must include:
- What was implemented (2–4 bullets)
- Key commit SHAs or commit range
- Any follow-up items or known limitations

### Step 6 — Close GitHub issues

<HARD-GATE>
Before closing any issue, verify the original issue requirements against what was implemented:
1. Re-read the issue body
2. Confirm each stated requirement is addressed in commits
3. If any requirement is missing: do NOT close — ask the user whether to descope or continue
</HARD-GATE>

```bash
bash skills/shipping-work-claude/scripts/close-issue.sh <number>
```

### Step 7 — Report

Present a summary table:

| Issue | Title | Status | Comment |
|---|---|---|---|
| #19 | ... | ✅ Closed | Summary posted |
