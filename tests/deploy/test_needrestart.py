"""needrestart lists restarts and never performs them (#331).

apt's ``DPkg::Post-Invoke`` hook (``/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/99needrestart``) runs
``needrestart -m u`` after every dpkg run. Ubuntu's patch turns ``-m u`` into
**automatic** restarts when ``$nrconf{restart}`` is unset — the stock state —
so a ``libc6`` security update would restart ``watcher`` and PostgreSQL
mid-apply, outside any window: the single process that runs the API, the
Procrastinate worker and both bus consumers, and the cluster under all three
databases. The drop-in makes the answer independent of whether
``NEEDRESTART_MODE=l`` survives every process between the operator and the
hook. Shape from CannObserv/notifier#91 and CannObserv/broker#65.

It governs needrestart's hook only, not maintainer scripts: ``postgresql-16``
restarts its own cluster on upgrade whatever this file says.

Tracked in ``deploy/``, installed as:

- ``needrestart.conf.d/watcher.conf`` -> ``/etc/needrestart/conf.d/``

Pure assertions on the tracked copy run everywhere; installed-parity and live
assertions skip where the node is not this one, CI included.
